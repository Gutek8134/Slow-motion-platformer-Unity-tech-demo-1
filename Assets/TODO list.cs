/*
 This is a TODO list, not a script. Do NOT attach it anywhere, future me.

Day 1:
1. Add Player - Done (IG)
2. Add basic movement using the new input system (because I'd have to learn it someday anyway) - Done (though it was mostly copied from Sidescroller, oh, well)

Day 2:
1. Add static "enemy", baically training dummy - Done
2. Add combat:
a. melee - it just has to work - Done
b. ranged - when entering target mode, slow time down (good luck with that one)

Day 3:
1. Add enemy behaviour
2. Add UI (even though you should earlier):
a. hp
b. stats?
c. abilities

Backlog (AKA whenever):
1. Advance movement (wall jumps, momentum, and so on)
2. Advance melee combat
3. Storyline if everything will seem good enough, maybe some prequel to the giga project? (bet it'll end up like Touhou), for that:
a. better graphic (ESPECIALLY for Ego, if it does end up being that prequel)
b. music and SFX
c. dialogue system
d. movement animations (custom sprites)

The list may (and surely WILL) expand.
